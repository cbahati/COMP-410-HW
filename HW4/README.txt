this program creates a basic kernel that prompts the user to enter text and echo that text
back onto the screen. this was developped on a linux machine running on a intel processor

to compile the code simple type the command

              "make"

then to run it you can either use GRUB or if qemu is installed on your system
you can type the 

       "qemu-system-i386 -kernel kernel"
